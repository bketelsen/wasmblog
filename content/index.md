It might be hard to spell, but fortunately you won't have to spell it that often.

Bartholomew is a Micro-CMS for hosting Markdown content on a WebAssembly server.
It can run on any [Wagi-compliant runtime](https://github.com/deislabs/wagi), including
Wagi, Hippo, and Wagi.Net.



## Getting Started

To get started, edit this page. While Bartholomew doesn't make a lot of assumptions about
your site, it _does_ assume that requests to the root (`/`) should be directed to
`index.md`.
